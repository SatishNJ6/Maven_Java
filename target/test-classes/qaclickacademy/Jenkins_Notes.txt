1) Jenkins is a continuous integration tool which is primarily developed for Automation -> building the jars, pushing code, automated test cases

2) Jenkins is used to automated everything without manual intervention(for eg: scheduling jobs at any time with help of maven cmds), 
just need to click on 'build now'

3) business people see reports and results in Jenkins, not in eclipse, if developer push code to Git, automaticaly it runs in Jenkins

4) command to launch jenkins in local machine -> go to the path where jenkins is downloaded, open cmd and type below cmd
           java -jar jenkins.war -httpPort=9090, login with admin/admin once it launches
           
5) configurations in jenkins before creating job, go to Manage Jenkins->Global Tool Configuration - configure all java, git and maven paths

6) creating job in jenkins ->click on New Item, before that we have to place project in jenkins home directory(C:\Users\satishku\jenkins), 
if we dont use git code- select 'use custom workspace' and give path as '${JENKINS_HOME}projectname, 
if we use git code, then configure git url in 'source code management' in jenkins

7) build periodically - to schedule jobs with cron expression 

8) build- invoke top-level maven targets -> Goals = test pRegression

9) post-build actions -> to configure for reports


10) testng-results.xml is required to get reports from jenkins(path:D:\Selenium\Mavenjava\target\surefire-reports\testng-results.xml)

11) To install any plugins in Jenkins -> manage jenkins->manage plugins search with req plugins

12) now search with "TestNG Results Plugin", now after installing go to project configurations and select "Publis TestNG Results"
    under "Post Build Actions".we can see graph after running multiple builds
